Graph 1 with 3 colors is unsatisfiable.


Graph 1 with 4 colors is satisfiable.
The solution printed out is:
-1 -28 -27 -26 25 -5 -9 -21 -24 -23 22 -14 -2 -18 -20 -19 17 -13 -16 15 -11 -12 10 -6 -8 7 -3 4
It shows that there are 28 variables, corresponding to 7 nodes and 4 colors. 
The true solution is: 
25, 22, 17, 15, 10, 7, 4
Reversing node2var, we get:
var		n		c
25		7		1
22		6		2
17		5		1
15		4		3
10		3		2
7		2		3
4		1		4


Graph 2 needs at least 8 colors.
